## About

I am a senior software engineer working primarily with C# and ASP.NET Core.

For many years, I worked on internal tooling platforms that appeared simple on the surface.
Only recently did I start to examine these systems as constrained backend systems, shaped by latency, correctness, and organizational boundaries.

This site documents that transition, through short analyses and technical notes, as I move deliberately toward system- and infrastructure-level engineering.

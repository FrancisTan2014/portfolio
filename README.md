## About

I am a senior software engineer working primarily with C# and ASP.NET Core.

Over the past years, I have worked on internal tooling platforms used by engineers and PMs.  
While these systems appear simple on the surface, they exposed me to the practical trade-offs of backend systems under real organizational constraints.

This site is a collection of short analyses and notes as I deliberately move toward system- and infrastructure-level engineering.
